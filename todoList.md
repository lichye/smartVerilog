Time_Left:
# 8 weeks before submission

Working_ON:
# DEBUGING
## make a vector to maintain unreachable state

Plan:
# Check about the next assertion


# Write a new preprocessing code
## Automatic layer analysis 
## Automatic Signal copyer
## Automatic variables poicker for sygus 
## Support for multiply layers of design

# Evalute the assertions
## Fix random seed to make the result the same
## Mutate the verilog circut and check the assertion is violate
## Check multiply false states
## Benchmark
### realworld && Companying work
### compare with other tools
### compare with the real assertion
### a large case test

# Write the paper - Overleaf
---------------------------



# add support for bv value
## make support for assertion like (value_a != 0bv8)

# Dockerfile

Future:


Sideway_Work: 
##  unbound checking
##  liveness property
