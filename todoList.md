TO_TALK:
# EBMC does not take cmdline of sv assertions
# TIME problem

TODO:
# make program that can make verilog assertions

## parse the smt function back
### https://github.com/polgreen/oracles/blob/master/image_oracles/define_fun_parser.h

## Merge verilog code with the assertion

## translate smt function to verilog assertions
## translate a state into verilog assertions

Future:

# mutate the verilog circut and check the assertion is violate ????

# automatic variables poicker for sygus
## constrainst the varibales
## huristic

# Make more test file (?)
## use the open-source benchmark


Sideway Work: 
## there is possible way to adjust to K-induction prove
