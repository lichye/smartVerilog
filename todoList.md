Time_Left:
# 7 weeks before submission

Found out:
# Check about the next assertion
### there does not exist good experssion for the states updates???
### |-> support for last state check
### |=> support for next state check

# Evalute the assertions
## Fix random seed to make the result the same

# Write a new preprocessing code
## Automatic variables poicker for sygus 
### would trigger effenciency issue

# Sygus
## different order of parameter would lead to different solving time


Plan:
# Setup the benchmark
# Evalute the assertions
## we might get different assertions when we run the sygus as there is different possible
## Mutate the verilog circut and check the assertion is violate
### ideas about waht is mutation and how is the mutation
## Check multiply false states
## Benchmark
### realworld && Companying work
### compare with other tools
### compare with the real assertion
### a large case test

# Write the paper - Overleaf
## Research paper
### what is the story
## Tool paper
---------------------------



# add support for bv value
## make support for assertion like (value_a != 0bv8)

# Dockerfile

Future:


Sideway_Work: 
##  unbound checking
##  liveness property
